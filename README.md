I am Alejandro Flores, student with a keen interest in Computational Biology and Applied Machine Learning for drug discovery.

### Education
Pharmacy Degree, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (2019 – 2024)

### Experience
#### Student Internship - Uppsala University (Jul 2023 – Present)
As an intern in the Computational Biology department, I am dedicated to unraveling the complexities of ligand-receptor interactions, with a primary focus on adenosine A2A and A2B receptors. My work involves utilizing molecular docking simulations through the Schrödinger software and the Q package for molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations in biomolecular systems. My goal is to decipher the intricate binding mechanisms of various compounds and optimize workflows using Python scripting.

#### Student Internship - Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Feb 2023 – Jul 2023)
During my internship at the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, I provided support to Professor Luiz Apaza in the preparation of scientific papers and conducted docking simulations to aid in the understanding of isolated products from traditional plants. This experience honed my skills in pharmaceutical chemistry and molecular docking simulations.

#### Research Internship - Hospital 12 de Octubre (Sep 2021 – Apr 2023)
As a research intern, I worked on a project investigating the potential connection between malaria and multiple myeloma (MM). Our findings suggest a potential link between Plasmodium falciparum infection and the development of MM, as some monoclonal antibodies produced by MM patients also recognize the parasite's protein. This experience provided me with valuable skills and knowledge in medical research.

#### Intern Student - Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Feb 2021 – Apr 2023)
As an intern student in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I have been learning biochemical and cell culture techniques, further enhancing my skill set in the field.
